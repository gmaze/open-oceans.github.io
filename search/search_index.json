The GEBCO_2021 Grid provides global coverage of elevation data in meters on a 15 arc-second grid of 43200 rows x 86400 columns, giving 3,732,480,000 data points. The GEBCO_2021 Grid is a continuous, global terrain model for ocean and land with a spatial resolution of 15 arc seconds. The grid uses as a \u2018base\u2019 Version 2 of the SRTM15+ data set (Tozer et al, 2019). This data set is a fusion of land topography with measured and estimated seafloor topography. It is augmented with the gridded bathymetric data sets developed by the four Seabed 2030 Regional Centers. The Regional Centers have compiled gridded bathymetric data sets, largely based on multibeam data, for their areas of responsibility. These regional grids were then provided to the Global Center. For areas outside of the polar regions (primarily south of 60\u00b0N and north of 50\u00b0S), these data sets are in the form of 'sparse grids', i.e. only grid cells that contain data were populated. For the polar regions, complete grids were provided due to the complexities of incorporating data held in polar coordinates. The compilation of the GEBCO_2021 Grid from these regional data grids was carried out at the Global Center, with the aim of producing a seamless global terrain model.

The data-driven models employed for the surge reconstruction were developed by Tadesse et al. (2020). The authors use five different atmospheric reanalysis products with different spatial and temporal resolution to produce surge information for the periods covered by the different reanalyses. The reanalysis that leads to the best validation results is marked with \"best reconstruction\" (note that in some locations data is not available for all reanalyses as there is no overlap in the periods covered by the tide gauges and the reanalysis). You can read the full paper here The full surge reconstruction for each reanalysis (comprised of 882 compressed individual .csv files for the different tide gauges) can be downloaded from the following links: 20-CR Surge Reconstruction [1836 - 2015] ERA-20C Surge Reconstruction [1900 - 2010] ERA-Interim Surge Reconstruction [1979 - 2019] MERAA-2 Reconstruction [1980 - 2019] ERA-Five Reconstruction [1979 - 2019] Citation \u00b6 Tadesse, M.G., Wahl, T.

Since site names included special characters like + or # or spaces which are not allowed in GEE naming convention we applied a consistent find and replace strategy to provide some level of consistency between locations. However in any case we hope the lat long provides a more accurate representation of a site. Another thing to note is that the CSVs seemed to have been exported with the index column which is not very useful and especially since it was missing a header, so the index column was removed from all CSVs before being renamed and ingested.

The authors used data on waste management, population density, and hydrological information to create this model. The dataset includes information on 40,760 watersheds and 182 different countries. The data is presented in a vector format. Plastic pollution in our oceans and on our coastlines have become a major threat to ocean health worldwide. A better understanding and quantification of marine plastic sources can help in implementing mitigation strategies to alleviate the issue. The dataset can help in identifying places that require higher attention in terms of plastic waste monitoring and mitigation plans. This data can also be used as a baseline measurement for ocean plastic mass balance exercises. This data was developed by researchers funded by The Ocean Cleanup Foundation. Methodology \u00b6 The amount of plastic inputs from rivers into the oceans was estimated by using data on mismanaged plastic waste production (MPW) per country, population density, topographic elevation, and location of artificial barriers (weirs and dams). For each catchment area mismanaged plastic waste production (MPW) rates per day were calculated by combining data on waste generation by inhabitant per day and population density for the area. This data was combined with water flow per river catchment area to provide a final value for the mass of plastic released at the river\u2019s mouth. This data was extrapolated using seasonal variations in water flow to create a year dataset. Data on population density was derived from the dataset Global 15 x 15 Minute Grids of the Downscaled Population by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) for 182 countries. Data used to calculate MPW rates were collected from seven peer reviewed studies. Topographic information was taken from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) hydrological model for surface/subsurface runoff and location of artificial barriers was taken from AquaStat and Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD). In total the dataset includes information for 40,760 watersheds worldwide. For the full documentation, please see the source methodology .

The semi-automated classification of the imagery was accomplished by manual selection of training points representing water and non-water classes along the entire global coastline. Polygon topology was applied to the GSV, resulting in a new characterisation of the number and size of global islands. Three size classes of islands were mapped: continental mainlands (5), islands greater than 1\u2005km2 (21,818), and islands smaller than 1\u2005km2 (318,868). The GSV represents the shore zone land and water interface boundary, and is a spatially explicit ecological domain separator between terrestrial and marine environments. The development and characteristics of the GSV are presented herein. An approach is also proposed for delineating standardised, high spatial resolution global ecological coastal units (ECUs). For this coastal ecosystem mapping effort, the GSV will be used to separate the nearshore coastal waters from the onshore coastal lands. The work to produce the GSV and the ECUs is commissioned by the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), and is associated with several GEO initiatives including GEO Ecosystems, GEO Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) and GEO Blue Planet.
